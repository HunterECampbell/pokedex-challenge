# Pokedex

This repo contains a simple pokemon listing app written in JS and Vue3. Your challenge is to convert it to TS. There really isn't a lot of code that needs to be converted, so it shouldn't take long. The real challenge is going to be figuring out how to convert an app to TS, not how to convert individual lines of code to TS.

The Details page is very simple right now, but I want you to put a little time into sprucing it up and adding relevant info.
